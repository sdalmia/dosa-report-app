# 💾 Dosa Report App

**Dosa Report App** is a lightweight internal tool built for the operations and accounts team at [Dosa Coffee](https://dosacoffee.in). It automates the process of uploading multiple Excel reports and generates a consolidated master output file, reducing manual effort and ensuring standardization across locations.

- Intelligent parsing, cleaning, and merging of data
- Download a consolidated master report in one click
- Optimized for Dosa Coffee’s multi-outlet reporting workflows
- Hosted with secure Google OAuth login for internal team access

---

## 💠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML (Jinja templates), Bootstrap (light styling)
- **Auth**: Google OAuth2
- **Deployment**: Render. Start command: `gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py run:app` (2 threaded workers, recycle after 500 requests).
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 📦 Setup Instructions (Local Development)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdalmia/dosa-report-app.git
cd dosa-report-app
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```ini
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
OWNER_EMAILS=siddhant@dalgreenfoods.com,dalmia.siddhant@gmail.com
```

`OWNER_EMAILS` is a comma-separated list of Google sign-in emails. Set it in Render. When it is missing or blank, the app uses `siddhant@dalgreenfoods.com` and `dalmia.siddhant@gmail.com`. Those accounts can see flags with area `accounts` or `people`, and any future accounts or HR page. Every other signed-in user does not receive those rows in the dashboard, on `/flags`, or in `/flags.json`.

### 5. Run the App

```bash
flask run
```

## 🔐 Authentication

Only users logged in with a Dosa Coffee Google Workspace account (or whitelisted accounts) can access the app. OAuth is enforced on upload/download routes to ensure internal use only.
